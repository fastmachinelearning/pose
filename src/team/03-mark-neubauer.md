bio: "My current research is to search for physics beyond the standard model through a detailed study of high-energy proton-proton collisions at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC). My research group searches for new physics using data from the ATLAS Experiment, with an emphasis on the Higgs boson as a sensitive tool for discovery and applications of machine learning to enhance our sensitivity to new physics. My group is also working to improve the experimental methods and apparatus in high-energy physics, including advancing scientific software and computing and developing fast electronics for highly-parallelized systems that track charged particles at the LHC. I also work to incorporate results and methods from my research at the intersection of AI/ML, physics, data science into the graduate and undergraduate curriculum at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign by developing courses such as Machine Learning for Physics, Instrumentation Physics: Applications of Machine Learning, and Data Analysis for Physics."
