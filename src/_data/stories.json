One common imaging mode captures 2D diffraction images at each pixel position in real space. The direct electron detectors used can reach 4K resolution at frame rates up to 5000 frames-per-second. This has led to orders of magnitude increase in the volume and velocity of the data collected, creating challenges in how to efficiently extract actionable information."

We then use distillation to train a smaller, quantized, easily-deployable version of the model to enable real-time inference and high throughput."

This work provides a proof-of-concept for real-time crystal structure detection in 4D-STEM, significantly increasing the potential for fast materials characterization and discovery."
